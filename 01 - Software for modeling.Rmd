**Models** are mathematical tools that can describe a system and capture relationships in the data given to them. Models can be used for various purposes, including predicting future events, determining if there is a difference between several groups, aiding map-based visualization, discovering novel patterns in the data that could be further investigated, and more. The utility of a model hinges on its ability to be reductive. The primary influences in the data can be captured mathematically in a useful way, such as in a relationship that can be expressed as an equation.  

Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, mathematical models have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, in both obvious and subtle ways. A typical day for many people might involve checking the weather to see when might be a good time to walk the dog, ordering a product from a website, typing a text message to a friend and having it autocorrected, and checking email. In each of these instances, there is a good chance that some type of model was involved. In some cases, the contribution of the model might be easily perceived (“You might also be interested in purchasing product X”) while in other cases, the impact could be the absence of something (e.g., spam email). Models are used to choose clothing that a customer might like, to identify a molecule that should be evaluated as a drug candidate, and might even be the mechanism that a nefarious company uses to avoid the discovery of cars that over-pollute. For better or worse, models are here to stay.

exists to create models and it has become easier to record data and make it accessible.

This book focuses largely on software. It is obviously critical that software produces the correct relationships to represent the data. For the most part, determining mathematical correctness is possible, but the reliable creation of appropriate models requires more.

First, it is important that it is easy to operate software in a proper way. The user interface should not be so poorly designed that the user would not know that they used it inappropriately. For example, Baggerly and Coombes (2009) report myriad problems in the data analyses from a high profile computational biology publication. One of the issues was related to how the users were required to add the names of the model inputs. The user interface of the software made it easy to offset the column names of the data from the actual data columns. This resulted in the wrong genes being identified as important for treating cancer patients and eventually contributed to the termination of several clinical trials (Carlson 2012).

If we need high quality models, software must facilitate proper usage. Abrams (2003) describes an interesting principle to guide us:

>Author's remark: The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks.

Data analysis and modeling software should espouse this idea.

The second important aspect of model building is related to scientific methodology. When working with complex predictive models, it can be easy to unknowingly commit errors related to logical fallacies or inappropriate assumptions. Many machine learning models are so adept at discovering patterns that they can effortlessly find empirical patterns in the data that fail to reproduce later. Some of these types of methodological errors are insidious in that the issue can go undetected until a later time when new data that contain the true result are obtained.  

Author's remark: As our models have become more powerful and complex, it has also become easier to commit latent errors.  

his same principle also applies to programming. Whenever possible, the software should be able to protect users from committing mistakes. Software should make it easy for users to do the right thing.

These two aspects of model development are crucial. Since tools for creating models are easily obtained and models can have such a profound impact, many more people are creating them. In terms of technical expertise and training, their backgrounds will vary. It is important that their tools be robust to the experience of the user. Tools should be powerful enough to create high-performance models, but, on the other hand, should be easy to use in an appropriate way. This book describes a suite of software for modeling which has been designed with these characteristics in mind.

The software is based on the R programming language (R Core Team 2014). R has been designed especially for data analysis and modeling. It is an implementation of the S language (with lexical scoping rules adapted from Scheme and Lisp) which was created in the 1970s to

R is open-source and free of charge. It is a powerful programming language that can be used for many different purposes but specializes in data analysis, modeling, visualization, and machine learning. R is easily extensible; it has a vast ecosystem of packages, mostly user-contributed modules that focus on a specific theme, such as modeling, visualization, and so on.

One collection of packages is called the tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019). The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. Several of these design philosophies are directly informed by the aspects of software described in this section. If you’ve never used the tidyverse packages, Chapter 2 contains a review of its basic concepts. Within the tidyverse, the subset of packages specifically focused on modeling are referred to as the tidymodels packages. This book is an extended software manual for conducting modeling using the tidyverse and tidymodels. It shows how to use a set of packages, each with its own specific purpose, together to create high-quality models.  

## 1.1 Types of models

Before proceeding, let’s describe a taxonomy for types of models, grouped by purpose. While not exhaustive, most models fall into at least one of these categories:  

### Descriptive models

he purpose of a descriptive model is to describe or illustrate characteristics of some data. The analysis might have no other purpose than to visually emphasize some trend or artifact in the data.

For example, large scale measurements of RNA have been possible for some time using microarrays. Early laboratory methods placed a biological sample on a small microchip. Very small locations on the chip can measure a signal based on the abundance of a specific RNA sequence. The chip would contain thousands (or more) outcomes, each a quantification of the RNA related to some biological process. However, there could be quality issues on the chip that might lead to poor results. A fingerprint accidentally left on a portion of the chip might cause inaccurate measurements when scanned.

An early method for evaluating such issues were probe-level models, or PLM’s (Bolstad 2004). A statistical model would be created that accounted for the known differences in the data, such as the chip, the RNA sequence, the type of sequence, and so on. If there were other, unknown factors in the data, these effects would be captured in the model residuals. When the residuals were plotted by their location on the chip, a good quality chip would show no patterns. When a problem did occur, some sort of spatial pattern would be discernible. Often the type of pattern would suggest the underlying issue (e.g. a fingerprint) and a possible solution (wipe the chip off and rescan, repeat the sample, etc.). Figure 1.1(a) shows an application of this method for two microarrays taken from Gentleman et al. (2005). The images show two different colors; red is where the signal intensity was larger than the model expects while the blue color shows lower than expected values. The left-hand panel demonstrates a fairly random pattern while the right-hand panel exhibits an undesirable artifact in the middle of the chip.
